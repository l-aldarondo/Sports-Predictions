# Sports-Predictions
A machine learning framework for sport result prediction

<br/>

## Background

### How Does Machine Learning Predict Sports Match Outcomes?

One of the common machine learning (ML) tasks, which involves predicting a target variable in previously unseen data, is classification. The aim of classification is to predict a target variable (class) by building a classification model based on a training dataset, and then utilizing that model to predict the value of the class of test data. This type of data processing is called supervised learning since the data processing phase is guided toward the class variable while building the model (see Fig. 1). Some common applications for classification include loan approval, medical diagnoses, email filtering, among others.

## Project Overview

### Purpose

Sport prediction is usually treated as a classification problem, with one class (win, lose, or draw) to be predicted. Although some researchers, have also looked at the numeric prediction problem, where they predict the winning margin â€“ a numeric value. In sport prediction, large numbers of features can be collected including the historical performance of the teams, results of matches, and data on players, to help different stakeholders understand the odds of winning or losing forthcoming matches. The decision of which team is likely to win is what we are aimimg to predict.

### Questions to be answer:

1. Which team is likely to win a championship or arrive in 1st place?

2. Which team is likely to win subchampionship or arrive in 2nd place?

3. What model had a higher accuracy?

4. Challenges during the project


### Metodology:

To achive our goal we will use the following apporach:

## Resources

### Datasets:

* season_stats.csv

* Dataset was created merging different tables for with different stats into one dataset and saved as season_stats.csv
* Data was scrapped from https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/years/1997.html#all_totals-team-opponent

### Software:

* Jupyter Notebook

* Python

* Pandas

* sqlalchemy

* scikit-Learn

* matplotlib

* seaborn

* PostgreSQL

* Tableau

* HTML template

## Project Outline

### Power Point / G Slides Presentation:

Mark

* We will create a PP or Google Slides  for our live presentation.

### Database:

Rafael

* We will use PostrgeSQL for our database

**place holder for sql schema**

### Machine Learning:

Leonardo

* We will use at least 3 models to compare against each other and determine wich model will provide a better prediction. 


#### Logistic Regression

A type of regression model that predicts a probability. Logistic regression models have the following characteristics:

The label is categorical. The term logistic regression usually refers to binary logistic regression, that is, to a model that calculates probabilities for labels with two possible values. A less common variant, multinomial logistic regression, calculates probabilities for labels with more than two possible values.

The loss function during training is Log Loss. (Multiple Log Loss units can be placed in parallel for labels with more than two possible values.)
The model has a linear architecture, not a deep neural network. However, the remainder of this definition also applies to deep models that predict probabilities for categorical labels.

#### Decision Tree
A supervised learning model composed of a set of conditions and leaves organized hierarchically.

#### Random Forest

An ensemble of decision trees in which each decision tree is trained with a specific random noise, such as bagging.

Random forests are a type of decision forest.

We may explore other models as we start working on the project

### Visualization:

Mark

* We wil use **Tableau** as our main visualization plataform for Story telling.

* Also will use Matplotlib and Seaborn for our notebook, PP and README visualizations.

### Deployment:

Mark/Rafael/Leonardo

* We will use Javascript, HTML/CSS to create a webpage to deploy our project

* webpage may be hosted at github pages or clouflare pages, but will explore other rich content options.
